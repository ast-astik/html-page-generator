+ #### After clicking the "Create" button in the admin panel, we start generating a page with the added content. Page generation creates HTML file with the specified file name and creates a new folder with the name of the new file in the *img* folder, and puts an image named *img.[file extension]* in the new folder, as well as page generation takes text from the inputs of the admin panel and adds it to new page. The newly generated page is styled from the previously created *new-page.css* style file.
